# Saved Scenes (用户模板) — Design

## Problem

Custom scenes (an uploaded background photo with hand-placed corners and an
optional painted occlusion mask) live only in React state. Reloading the page
loses them; the only persistence path today is the developer-facing "Copy
corners" snippet pasted into `src/data/presets.ts`. Users want to save a
finished custom scene and reuse it later from the gallery.

## Decisions (confirmed with user)

1. **What a template contains:** background image + corners + occlusion mask.
   Grade/blend parameters are NOT saved — they are tuned per inserted user
   image, not per scene.
2. **Save entry point:** both custom uploads and built-in presets. Saving a
   preset (e.g. after painting an occlusion mask, which no bundled preset has
   yet) creates an independent user copy in "My templates"; the built-in entry
   itself is untouched. The developer-facing Copy-corners → presets.ts
   workflow stays as is.
3. **Re-save semantics:** saving an opened saved scene updates it in place
   (same id). No duplicate entries, no version history.
4. **Storage:** IndexedDB, hand-rolled promise wrapper, no new dependency.
   (localStorage rejected: ~5MB quota vs multi-MB photos. File export/import
   rejected: manual file management defeats "save and reuse".)

## Data model & storage layer

New file `src/lib/savedScenes.ts`. Database `billboard-replacer`, version 1,
single object store `scenes` keyed by `id`.

```ts
export interface SavedScene {
  id: string;            // crypto.randomUUID()
  name: string;          // user-typed, plain string (not localized)
  bgBlob: Blob;          // original upload bytes — no re-encode, no quality loss
  maskBlob: Blob | null; // PNG serialization of the mask canvas; null if never painted
  thumbBlob: Blob;       // ~480px JPEG for the gallery card
  corners: Corners;      // [TL, TR, BR, BL], normalized 0..1 (existing convention)
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

Public API (all promise-based, lazily open the DB on first call):

- `listScenes(): Promise<SavedScene[]>` — sorted by `updatedAt` descending.
- `putScene(scene: SavedScene): Promise<void>` — insert or overwrite by id.
- `deleteScene(id: string): Promise<void>`.

The wrapper is ~80 lines of plain `indexedDB` calls wrapped in promises,
matching the project's no-framework style.

## State flow (useEditor)

`EditorSource` gains two optional fields:

- `bgBlob?: Blob` — the original background bytes. `openCustom` currently
  decodes the `File` and drops it; it must now stash the `File` (a `Blob`)
  here so saving stores original bytes instead of a canvas re-encode.
  `openSaved` sets it from the stored record. `openPreset` leaves it
  undefined; `saveScene` then fetches the preset's `src` (also stashed on
  `EditorSource` as `bgSrc?: string`) to obtain the bytes at save time.
- `savedId?: string` — identity of an already-saved template; presence means
  "update in place" on the next save.

`kind` stays `"custom"` for saved scenes once they are reopened from "My
templates" — they behave exactly like a fresh custom scene (draggable
corners, paintable mask, saveable) regardless of whether they originated from
an upload or a preset. While still in the preset editor session, saving sets
`savedId` but `kind` remains `"preset"` (the Adjust/lock toggle keeps
working); subsequent saves in that session update the same template.

New `EditorApi` methods:

- `openSaved(scene: SavedScene)` — decode `bgBlob` via a new
  `blobToImage` helper (object URL + existing `loadImage`), restore the mask
  via `createMaskCanvas` + `drawBaseImage` (same path presets with a `mask`
  PNG use), dispatch `OPEN` with `editable: true`, then `SET_MASK_CANVAS` if a
  mask was stored.
- `saveScene(name: string): Promise<void>` — resolve the background bytes
  (`source.bgBlob`, else `fetch(source.bgSrc)` for presets), serialize
  `maskCanvas.canvas.toBlob("image/png")` when the mask has been touched,
  render a ~480px JPEG thumbnail from the background image, then `putScene`
  with `id = source.savedId ?? crypto.randomUUID()`. On first save, write the
  new `savedId` (and the possibly-renamed `name`) back into state via a new
  `MARK_SAVED` action.

Mask serialization note: the stored mask PNG is the mask canvas at its capped
resolution (long side ≤ 2048, see `createMaskCanvas`); restoring draws it
scaled to fill a fresh mask canvas, which is the same tolerance the preset
mask path already accepts.

`maskTouched` gating: only serialize the mask when `state.maskTouched` is
true; an untouched (all-black) canvas stores as `null`.

## UI

**Editor sidebar** (rendered for every source, custom and preset alike):

- A "存为模板 / Save as template" button. Clicking reveals an inline name
  input pre-filled with the current scene name (preset names resolved through
  `loc(name, lang)`); confirming calls `saveScene(name)` and flashes a
  "已保存 / Saved" toast.
- When `source.savedId` exists the button reads "更新模板 / Update template".
- Saving requires no user image — a template is the scene itself.

**Gallery:**

- New "我的模板 / My templates" section rendered as its own collection block
  below the preset collection (the BYO upload card stays the last cell of the
  preset grid). Hidden entirely when there are no saved scenes (and when
  IndexedDB is unavailable).
- A `useSavedScenes` hook loads the list on mount (async) and exposes the
  scene list plus `remove(id)`. No refresh method is needed: the Gallery
  remounts on every return from the editor, so the mount-time load is always
  fresh.
- Cards reuse the `preset-card` look; thumbnails come from
  `URL.createObjectURL(thumbBlob)`, revoked on unmount. Each card has a small
  delete button with a two-click confirm: first click flips it to a "确认删除?
  / Delete?" state (auto-reverts after ~3s), second click deletes. No native
  `confirm()` dialogs. Clicking the card itself calls `openSaved`.

**i18n:** ~10 new typed `STRINGS` entries (section title, save/update button,
name placeholder, confirm/cancel, saved toast, delete label, delete confirm,
save-failure message). All text through `t(key)` per existing convention.

## Error handling

- IndexedDB unavailable (e.g. some private-browsing modes): gallery hides the
  "My templates" section; the save button still renders but surfaces a toast
  error on failure. The rest of the app is unaffected.
- `putScene` failure (quota exceeded): caught in `saveScene`, surfaced through
  the existing error/toast mechanism with a dedicated i18n string.
- Preset background `fetch` failure (e.g. offline): same save-failure toast;
  nothing is written to the store.
- Stored-record decode failure on open: surface the existing `error.load`
  path, stay in the gallery.

## Testing

No test runner exists (per CLAUDE.md). Verification:

- Pure logic in `savedScenes.ts` sanity-checked ad hoc (`npx tsx` where it
  doesn't touch DOM APIs).
- End-to-end via headless Chrome over CDP (existing harness approach):
  upload → drag corners → paint mask → save → reload → open from
  "My templates" → assert corners match and mask pixels survived the
  round-trip; delete → section empties. Repeat the save → reload → reopen
  pass starting from a built-in preset (mask painted on the preset).

## Out of scope

- Cross-device sync or file export of templates.
- Version history / duplicates on re-save.
- Persisting grade/blend parameters or the inserted user image.
